## Branch Creation
When Creating you're branch at a CODEOWNERS file with one line formatted like this:

`* @github-username`

This essentially makes you the branch admin so that only you can approve any incoming pull request to your branch

* Whenever you push to your branch, use a force push to overide the branch protections.
* If you are working on someone elses code, create a pull request to their branch so that they can review it and make changes before approving.
