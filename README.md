## Branch Creation
When Creating you're branch, add a CODEOWNERS file with one line formatted like this:

`* @github-username`

This essentially makes you the branch admin so that only you can approve any incoming pull request to your branch

* Whenever you push to your branch, use a force push to overide the branch protections.
* If you are working on someone elses code, create a pull request to their branch so that they can review it and make changes before approving.

## Important Note
Please try to keep the code in this repo relatively up to date so were all on the same age and working together. Clone this repository and work directly from it if possible. Or just reupload your files from your local drives at the end of a workday or whatever works.
